# Project 1 - Boids
I have implemented a simple 2d boid simulation in processing, per the assignment requirements. 
Each boid is represented as a twitter icon because of the similarity to birds.
Obstacles are drawn as large red circles with a black outline.

## Features
* Separation
  * Required - boids will separate a small distance from each other, as if they needed "personal space"
* Alignment
  * Reqired - boids will generally face/move in the same direction as the surrounding crowd.
* Cohesion
  * Required - boids will attempt to move in a "flock"
* Additional Behavoirs/Obstacle Avoidance/User Interaction
  * Additional - my boids will avoid obstacles placed on the scene
  * Use key 'o' to place a boid at (mouseX, mouseY)
* Benchmarking/User Interaction
  * Additional - console output to determine framerate
  * Use key 't' to toggle benchmarking, default is ON
* Improved boid rendering
  * Additional - used logos instead of simple shapes
  * Did not get rotation to work properly
* Boid spawning/User Interaction
  * Click the canvas to place a boid
